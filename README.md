# Synonymous

Synonymous is an unofficial JSON API exposing data from [thesaurus.com](thesaurus.com). It is extremely bare-bones, yet provides all the information provided by the site itself. Requests can be made in the form `synonymous.heroku.com/word`. For an example application using this data, see [synonymous.el](https://github.com/toroidal-code/synonymous.el).
